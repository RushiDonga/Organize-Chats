[2025-05-20, 9:05:21 AM] Sameer Patel: Yep! I’m working on the third draft now.
[2025-05-20, 9:06:00 AM] Anjali Verma: Also, reminder to update your availability for the event next week.
[2025-05-20, 9:07:15 AM] Karan Mehta: What time is the event again?
[2025-05-20, 9:07:42 AM] Riya Sharma: May 27th, 4 PM at Hall A, Student Center.
[2025-05-20, 9:08:05 AM] Sameer Patel: I’m free after 3 PM. Count me in.
[2025-05-20, 9:10:23 AM] Karan Mehta: Riya, can you check the budget for printing posters?
[2025-05-20, 9:11:12 AM] Riya Sharma: Sure, I’ll confirm with the finance team and update.
[2025-05-20, 9:12:45 AM] Anjali Verma: Let’s finalize the event name today too: “Spring Pulse 2025”? 😄
[2025-05-20, 9:13:33 AM] Karan Mehta: “Spring Pulse 2025” sounds energetic! I’m in.
[2025-05-20, 9:14:22 AM] Sameer Patel: Wait, wasn’t it “Bloom Fest”? 🤔
[2025-05-20, 9:14:40 AM] Riya Sharma: Haha, sounds like a gardening show. 😄
[2025-05-20, 9:15:00 AM] Karan Mehta: 😂 Riya wins the roast of the day!
[2025-05-20, 9:16:27 AM] Anjali Verma: Okay so, “Spring Pulse 2025” it is then?
[2025-05-20, 9:17:11 AM] Riya Sharma: Yup, let's lock it. I’ll update the marketing team.
[2025-05-20, 9:18:05 AM] Sameer Patel: Reminder: submit your poster ideas by 3 PM today!
[2025-05-20, 9:18:33 AM] Karan Mehta: Quick question—should we also invite alumni?
[2025-05-20, 9:19:12 AM] Riya Sharma: Good idea, I’ll bring it up with the organizers.
[2025-05-20, 9:20:00 AM] Anjali Verma: Let’s cluster the responsibilities now: Karan - logistics, Riya - outreach, Sameer - design.
[2025-05-20, 9:20:44 AM] Karan Mehta: Agreed.
[2025-05-20, 9:21:15 AM] Sameer Patel: Sounds good to me.
[2025-05-20, 9:22:01 AM] Riya Sharma: All set! Let's make this event awesome.
[2025-05-20, 9:23:17 AM] Sameer Patel: Let’s hope it’s not like last time when the mic didn’t work 😅
[2025-05-20, 9:24:02 AM] Karan Mehta: Don’t jinx it bro 😂

[2025-05-20, 9:25:30 AM] Anjali Verma: Should we add a map to the poster or digital invite? Something to show the exact venue?
[2025-05-20, 9:26:05 AM] Sameer Patel: Ohhh yes! I can integrate a Leaflet map with a pin on Hall A.
[2025-05-20, 9:26:33 AM] Riya Sharma: Great idea. Maybe also add a short description below with directions.
[2025-05-20, 9:27:10 AM] Karan Mehta: If we do this digitally, let’s also add the latitude and longitude—just in case someone wants to plug it into Google Maps.
[2025-05-20, 9:27:42 AM] Anjali Verma: Can we also include parking info in the map context?
[2025-05-20, 9:28:18 AM] Sameer Patel: Totally. I’ll add a little “📍 You are here” popup and maybe a “P” icon nearby for parking.
[2025-05-20, 9:29:03 AM] Riya Sharma: I’ll ask the admin if we can get the official address for Hall A to display it below the map.
[2025-05-20, 9:30:27 AM] Karan Mehta: I'll coordinate with campus services to get a clean map image in case the app version doesn't load.
[2025-05-20, 9:31:15 AM] Sameer Patel: I’ll handle the code. Using react-leaflet, I can center the map at (28.6129, 77.2295) for now as a placeholder.
[2025-05-20, 9:31:58 AM] Anjali Verma: Let’s also use a clean color for the map card—emerald green, maybe?
[2025-05-20, 9:32:30 AM] Riya Sharma: Perfect, that matches our “Spring” theme too.
[2025-05-20, 9:33:12 AM] Sameer Patel: Alright, I’ll update the UI component and add a "Maps" title to the card.
[2025-05-20, 9:34:03 AM] Karan Mehta: Can we preview this by tonight?
[2025-05-20, 9:34:25 AM] Sameer Patel: For sure. I’ll push the changes to GitHub by evening.
[2025-05-20, 9:35:00 AM] Riya Sharma: Awesome teamwork, folks!

[2025-05-20, 9:36:11 AM] Anjali Verma: After the event, should we do a small outing? Maybe unwind somewhere?
[2025-05-20, 9:36:50 AM] Karan Mehta: I'm down. We’ve earned it after all this planning!
[2025-05-20, 9:37:10 AM] Riya Sharma: Ooo let’s visit the Lachine Lighthouse in Montreal. It’s peaceful and perfect for photos.
[2025-05-20, 9:37:44 AM] Sameer Patel: Wow, yes! That’s by the water right? I’ve always wanted to go.
[2025-05-20, 9:38:15 AM] Anjali Verma: Count me in! Can we bike there along the Lachine Canal?
[2025-05-20, 9:38:59 AM] Karan Mehta: Great idea. I'll check if there are bike rentals nearby.
[2025-05-20, 9:39:33 AM] Sameer Patel: I can add a second Leaflet map showing the route from downtown Montreal to the lighthouse.
[2025-05-20, 9:40:00 AM] Riya Sharma: It’s located at: Lachine Lighthouse, Saint-Joseph Blvd, Montreal, QC H8S 2L3
[2025-05-20, 9:40:35 AM] Anjali Verma: Let’s make a little travel guide—bike path, food spots near, maybe a picnic plan?
[2025-05-20, 9:41:15 AM] Sameer Patel: Noted! Adding all that to the event after-party doc. We’ll make this a full day of fun.`
